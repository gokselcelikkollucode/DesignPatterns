/**
 * Static block initialization implementation is similar to eager initialization, except that instance of class is created in the static block that provides option for exception
 * handling.
 * <p>
 * Both eager initialization and static block initialization creates the instance even before itâ€™s being used and that is not the best practice to use. So in further sections, we
 * will learn how to create Singleton class that supports lazy initialization.
