Thanks to the Lazy<T> helper, the instance of Heavy is created lazily, only on demand.
We can also see that the first call to get created the instance, but the second call to get is returning the pre-created instance.
The Lazy<T> helper does a good job of encapsulating and lazily creating the instance.
!!!This implementation, however, does not guarantee any thread safety (the C# Lazy<T> does).
